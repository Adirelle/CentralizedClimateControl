## Centralized air conditioning system for RimWorld

Build networks of pulsed air pipes and machines to keep your colonists cool.

This a sequel to [ColdToad's Centralized Climate Control](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=973091113) (CCC).

## So what is different from the previous versions?

- The internals have been rewritten from scratch. Old bugs are gone but there should be new bugs.
- The same pipes and buildings are availables but their building cost, power consumption and capacities
  have been changed.
- Oh, there is a new thing: wall-mounted intake fans. Less powerful that ground-based ones but more practical.
- The maximum air flow of a network is capped by both its inputs and outputs.
- The buildings now show a bit more information about their stats, states and the network they belongs to.
- The powerered buildings of industrial tier consumes less power at lower load.
- Temperature control units (TCU) might get overloaded in case of high temperature difference, in which case they would not heat/cool the air enough to reach the target temperature. You might want to build spare TCUs ahead of time to handle those heat waves or cold snaps.

## Is it compatible with CCC 1.x ?

Yes and no. The changes between the two versions are too drastic, so the buildings from CCC 1.x should be removed
and rebuilt with CCC 2.0. The two mods might work side by side but I have not tested this so I do not recommend it.
