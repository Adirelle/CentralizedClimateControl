This is a continuation of ColdToads excellent mod that is no longer updated.

All work except the update to RimWorld 1.1 has been done by the mods previous authors.
I will do my best to keep this mod alive.

This Mod allows centralized air cooling/heating. Build large Climate Systems in your map away from your buildings. This overcomes certain late game drawbacks like building excessive coolers and ramping up the electricity usage as we enter late game.

This mod works by adding a few buildings namely:
- Air Intake Machine
- Air Climate Unit
- Air Vents

We connect these machines through Pipes. The Mod also manages various Pipe Networks that the user can create. It also maintains air just like electricity by generating it at Intakes and exhausting it at Vents.

The Mod calculates two Efficiencies which are:
- Thermal Efficiency

    Depends on the speed at which the climate units can heat/cool the air blowing in from the intake machines.

- Flow Efficiency

    Depends on the number of vents open in the network and the total intake air of the network.

These two efficiencies ultimately dictate the rate and amount of change in temperature. Certain ingame events like Cold Snap, Heat waves or Solar Flare can affect temperatures and the Air Network's reliability is defined by these two params.

There are some larger intakes and climate units available in the late game for larger maps.
